# AI-project

As part of my artificial intelligence courses, my group and I created a game in which a player competes against an artificial intelligence.  
The game coded in Python is in the file final_version.py.

## Game description

The game takes place on the generated game board. Both players have 0 penalty points. The points that make up the game board are equidistant from each other. Each player in his turn makes a move connecting any two unconnected points with a straight line. A player who crosses a previously drawn line receives one penalty point. The game ends when it is no longer possible to draw a straight line because all the points are already connected. The player who receives the least number of penalty points wins. If the number of penalty points is the same for both players, then the result is a draw. 

## Additional software requirements

At the beginning of the game, the human-player defines how many points will form the game board. The game board can contain between 15 and 25 points and is generated before the game starts.
